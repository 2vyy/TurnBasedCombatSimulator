# A turn-based combat simulator in C++
This project is intended to implement a traditional action-value algorithm used in many turn-based RPGS and gradually expand upon it. Currently, this project is powered by [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) for log formatting and [catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) as a testing framework.
